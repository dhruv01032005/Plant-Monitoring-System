# Plant-Monitoring-System
## ABOUT
This project was first done in the group of 32 in which my work was the integration of the sensors with ESP32 and getting the values on phone using Wi-Fi and seen on a Mobile App. In this I worked with Naveen Pal and Anurag Singh. \
The second project was done in the group of 12 and the product was same but we have to think from the design perspective instead of technical perspective. In this I worked in prototyping it and make it look good so I learned how to work on workshop machines in it.

## AIM
This project aims at checking the main features of the plant like moisture, humidity, temperature, pH and NPK content which helps to determine the growth of the plant.

## OBJECTIVE
We want that the checking of the growth of plants in mass should become easy and accessible for all.
